# The_Cape_Jeremy_Affair-2010
Digital Score: a play for musicians (for 2 instruments (contrasting) and 2 laptops)


The Cape Jeremy Affair is an experimental music theatre composition for 2 musicians and 2 laptop computers. It is created from a text: a 1969 sledge report from the British Antarctic Survey that described an arduous, and ultimately aborted, rescue attempt by four dog teams from Stonington Island to Fossil Bluff, where several geophysicists had sought shelter following a plane crash. The 30-day trip started as a routine dog sledging expedition conducting a geophysical survey along the way. But it ended up being a survival exercise with 4 men and 27 huskies adrift on an ice floe.

The Cape Jeremy Affair was commissioned by York Theatre Royal.

NOTE: These scores are based in software. Although they share many similar properties to that of paper based/traditional scoring methods, they also benefit from the usability and functionality of dynamic software environments. The visual information will be familiar to the musician and welcomed by a curious spirit of adventure. Above all, these scores are responsive, evolving as the performance progresses – giving the feeling of being alive – and should be considered as co-operative creative partners.

IMPORTANT -

1) This score is based in Max/MSP. This must be downloaded and installed prior to operation.

2) Some of the folders contain a document called 'get_files'. These provide a link to media files stored on Dropbox that are required to operate the score. These must be downloaded first and placed in each of the correspondng folders.

## Performers instructions
The Cape Jeremy Affair is an experimental music theatre composition for 2 musicians and 2 laptop computers. The role of the computer is both functional (score generator) and performative, as such this piece should be considered a quartet.
I describe this piece as a ‘play’ for musicians, in so much as each musician has a responsibility to a narrative exposition – however abstract this may be – and approaches the performance embracing any of the definitions for the word play (noun or verb). The role of the musician is to contribute to a sense of place – in this case the reality within the written report. Although it is not imperative that the musicians read the original text, it is however important that they read the abstract and programme notes. Of paramount importance is that each musician enters into the spirit of the piece.

## Abstract (please read)

## Instructions
1. Setup in a normal way with the laptop screen positioned as with a traditional paper score
2. Load a version of The Cape Jeremy Affair software on each laptop, and open
3. On a mutually agreed signal press the on-screen start button in unison: the play starts
4. Each computer will start to perform a soundscape generated from a fixed library of
• A recording of the original text recited by the author
• Field recordings from places mentioned in the text
• Field recordings of sounds mentioned in the text
• Electroacoustic miniatures created in response to the text or
are treatments of the above field recordings • Silence
5. Each computer will generate a visual score for the musician to follow (see below). This score is generated from a fixed library of
• Scans of the original pages from the report
• The first five pages from Sinfonia Antartica by R. Vaughan Williams (study score)
• Black screen
6. Each musician auralises a response through improvisation
using their voice or their instrument.
7. At any given moment for any given duration, this improvisation can be positioned between literal and abstract associations to the visual and/ or aural stimulus. This response can move freely across this range, it can identify with individual elements within the collective sound or fragments of visual information; it can be proactive or reactive; it can be dependent or independent. Alternatively, the musician can choose to do nothing.
8. Exceptions:
• No “free” association improvisation; however, this does not
exclude extended or avant-garde instrumental techniques
• The recital of the text can involve speech, song, chant, or Sprechstimme, or a mixture or combination of these. This
can include vocal sounds, emotional utterance or language
• The texts can be read in their original syntax and context, or
as abstract poetry, graphical score, libretto, material for loop,
or as a mixture or combination of these
• All sounds – instrumental and vocal – must be performed
using the microphone. The walkie-talkie is reserved for
vocal sounds.
9. After 20 minutes the screen will remain black and the
soundscape will stop. At this point the musicians draw the play to a close.

## Notes on devised rehearsals
The role of the musician is to work in collaboration with all the elements to create a sense of the place within the report. The evolving composition will be a negotiation between the ears and the eyes with the intellect and the imagination. The overall effect should be one of the sensorial not the cognitive. There will be a sensitive line between artistic intent and perceived success as such the realisation of this piece should be developed through a series of devised rehearsals.

## Technical setup
1. Connect each laptop to the speaker system through a mixer. Ideally, a dedicated soundcard would be used, although using the headphone output socket of the laptop is acceptable.
2. Each instrument will need a microphone(s), and a dedicated vocal microphone connected to the mixer. Reverb can be added.
3. Press the 'Start Audio button (green). The play has begun.
